Used Three.js to create a 3D image.

I chose this technology mainly because it is exciting to me to be able to create 3D images in my
applications.

This technology solves problems with presentation. 3D, dynamic images are attention grabbing. Furthermore, they
can convert an ordinary paragraph of information into a stimulating presentation.

Thus far i've only built a simple cube. However, I understand the potential of this technology
to develop more complex models.

The challenge going forward will be to overlay text and other images on models. This way models can
become informative presentations as opposed to just aesthetically pleasing.
